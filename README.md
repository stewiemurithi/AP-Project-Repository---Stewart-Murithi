# AP-Project-Repository---Stewart-Murithi

The Python file of importance for this project is the OklahomaGUI.py
It, along with the associated csv files, is capable of running without the need to pre-run other Python codes.
OklahomaGUI.py integrates a Random Forest Regression model from the ADA project but that has been saved as Oklahoma_RFR_model.joblib
The Python file, TornadoPred2.py, is included in this repository simply for reference purposes to understand the code guiding the creation of the model.
Otherwise, in order to run TornadoPred.py, other datasets and Python files are required that can be found on:
